      <h1>Who is gun toting in Charm City?</h1>
      <p>The City of Baltimore Maryland, otherwise known as "Charm City" keeps tabs on gun offenders and released records relating to almost 3,000 offenders via Data.Gov. The site description explains that the dataset <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/gunoffenders" target="blank">(download link)</a> "represents the Gun Offender Registry for persons convicted of at least one gun-related offense and are required to register their name and address with police; also required to check-in with police every 6 months for three years".  </p>

      <p>Please join me to explore some of the findings in a visual journey below.</p>

      <h3>December 26</h3>
      <p>Initially, the scatter plot produced below suggested that the day after Christmas was a wild card for reported offenses, but on deeper inspection, this seems to only be true for the years of 2018 and 2019. Perhaps this reflects some reason related to a clerical issue, but it would be interesting to be able to find out why especially in light of the fact that this was only for two of 12 years that included Christmas (2021 Christmas has not happened as of the day of this writing). Maybe law enforcement increased neighborhood sweeps?</p>

        <h3>Crimes Over time</h3>
        <p>It seems that there has been a sharp increase in the number of registered offenders with a decline that may suggest a Covid-19 related decline as seen in the line chart below. If the pandemic is related to the decline, one has to wonder if there were actually less offenses or if this is actually related to government closures interfering with reportin. Other possiblilities include the fact that mobility was restricted, bars were shut down and the increased economic benefits offered by the government in response to shut downs. Perhaps all or some of those factors contributed to a decrease in firearm violations</p>

      <h3>Dreams of supplemental data</h3>
      <p>What little nuggets of insights could we get with more information? Unfortunately the nature of the offenses are not listed as part of this dataset. Are these simple gun possession violations or was a serious crime involved? Sex offender statistics, how funding is distributed in the community, educational access, employment statistics and proximity to to mental health services are only few potential resources that could help to "flesh out" the information gleaned during the analytical process that produced the above insights with the hope of telling a "human story" of "why" these crimes happened and "how" to fix it.</p>
